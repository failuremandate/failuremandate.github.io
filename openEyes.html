<p "text-dark mb-5">
            OpenEyes™ is a collaborative, open source project developed with contributions from a range of hospitals, institutions, academic departments, companies and individuals. As an open source application, OpenEyes™ provides a cost effective option for eye care. It cannot be sold to 3rd parties and is protected by the OpenEyes Foundation for the benefit of its users. The OpenEyes™ installer can be found at the following address: https://github.com/openeyes/oe_installer
<br>

While OpenEyes can be downloaded and used free of charge, we recommend that clinical installation are handled professionally through our commercial partner AB EHR Digital. AB EHR Digital will ensure that you clinical data integrates with hospital workflows and PAS systems and that the connections to devices such as OCT machines or visual field devices are robust.
<br>
AB EHR Digital can be contacted to provide a visit and demonstration

Open Eyes is intuitive and fast. It runs in a web browser to ensure that it can be accessed wherever needed. It includes a graphical user interface organised around Eyedraw elements, which allow input of clinical data through a series of icons that relate to disease states.
<br>
OpenEyes Dashboard View
When you start OpenEyes you will see a dashboard view of your clinic. Using configurable widgets you will be able to see patients in your clinic work list and track their progress in the clinic. The dashboard also shows the messaging feature whereby patient records can be tagged with notes advising on clinical state or future actions. These messages are embedded in the patient record and support clinicians to clinician communication to ensure that patients requiring urgent attention can be flagged.
<br>

<br>
The messaging application allows point to point communication with a priority setting to ensure that no patient is lost.

Eyedraw: the fastest way to enter clinical information
The Eyedraw tools are a key feature of OpenEyes. An example of the anterior segment tool is shown below which allows the recording of cataract state. These descriptions are stored as SNOMED coded items which can be searched in the OE database.
<br>
<img src="../img/eydraw.png">
<br>
The data collected with these tools can be used to support risk assessment – for example to populate data for the PCR risk calculator.

<br>
Or the assessment of diabetic retinopathy grading
<br>

<br>
The clinical assessment of the posterior pole can also be assessed graphically, for example for a patient with a branch retinal vein occlusion.
<br>

<br>
Correspondence can also be automated and generated within OpenEyes to summarise diagnosis and treatment.
<br>
Device Integration
<br>
OpenEyes supports device connectivity via DICOM. For example, OpenEyes can pull the data from IOLmasters and other biometry devices into the application for display at the time of surgery. The same technology can be used to display visual field, OCT data or fundus images.
<br>

<br>
The lens selection is then available automatically in the cataract operation note.
<br>

<br>
Data and Audit
<br>
OpenEyes is fully compliant with the Royal College of Ophthalmologist's national cataract audit dataset and can return data for group or individual analysis. OpenEyes provide a rich set of tools so that you can view your personal audit data in real time. The data analytics package for cataract provides a risk adjust plot of PCR outcome that can be exported for appraisal purposes.
